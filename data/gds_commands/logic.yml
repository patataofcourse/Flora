  if:
    id: 0x12
    aliases:
    - jumpUnless
    desc: Executes a boolean expression consisting of instructions and logic flags, and jumps away if the condition is false (which is the default if no condition is provided).
    complex: true
  elif:
    id: 0x16
    aliases:
    - jumpUnlessTargetAnd
    desc: If reached through regular program flow, always jumps. If reached from a `jump` instruction, executes the logic of `jump`.
    complex: true
  else:
    id: 0x17
    aliases:
    - jumpUnlessTarget
    desc: If reached through regular program flow, always jumps. If reached from a `jump` instruction, simply continues.
  repeatN:
    id: 0x14
    desc: Takes an loop count (int) and a jump target (addr), and loops the instructions up to that target location that many times.
    complex: true
  while:
    id: 0x15
    desc: Takes a boolean expression like `if`, as well as a jump target (addr), and loops the instructions up to that target location until the condition evaluates to false or a break token is encountered.
    complex: true
  
  "true":
    id: 0x19
    condition: true
    desc: Always returns true
  "false":
    id: 0x1a
    condition: false
    desc: Always returns false
  
  return:
    id: 0x4f
    desc: Aborts the script by setting the instruction pointer past its end.

  0x18:
    condition: true
    desc: Might have been a debug condition, because the logic to determine its value is just a function that returns false. Probably got compiled out.
