  partdef:
    id: 0xc2
    desc: |
      Defines a gizmo/dog part for use in the minigame. This definition consists of the display position of the part
      sprite once placed, and a separate "slide target" point where the gizmo sprite will linearly slide toward when
      clicked, before vanishing and being replaced with the realized part. Note that the sprite ID for the gizmo in the
      tray is not assumed to be the same ID as the part itself, though in practice it turned out that way.
    params:
      partId: int
      xPos: int
      yPos: int
      gizmoSpriteId: int
      slideTargetX: int
      slideTargetY: int
