  sprite:
    id: 0x23
    desc: >
      Defines a tiny sprite used in the room, from the "room_%i_%i.arc" files. Never actually used,
      but the sprites look like sweet cut content.

    params:
      speaker:
        type: int
        desc: >
          1 for Layton, 2 for Luke. Probably corresponds to the frames in ani/room_tobjp.spr,
          which also includes the hint coin, but doesn't include anything else; my assumption is
          that using a number outside of these two (and maybe 3) will break something. It's worth
          testing how adding frames to the sprite file will affect things...

  npcObject:

  eventTrigger:
    id: 0x21
    desc: >
      Unused command that does something similar to `0x87 npcObject`, but without registering a sprite.
      Internally this method is called by that one, because it is responsible for determining the popup
      icon on tap (though this is hardcoded now to always be the exclamation point).

      animName:
        type: string
        desc: Within the sprite container, the name of the animation to be displayed.
      eventId:

    params:
      coinId:
        type: int
        desc: Every hint coin has a unique ID, presumably to allow saving which ones you've collected.

  mapInfo:
    id: 0x5a
    desc: >
      As far as I can tell, this is used to setup info on the top screen (& probably for the save
      process). Can also be used from events to briefly change scenes.
    params:
      roomId:
        type: int
        desc: the current room. Mostly useful when called from event scripts.
      mapId:

  nazobabaBottle:
    id: 0xe4

      width: int
      height: int
      unused: int
  nazobabaAwards:
    id: 0xe5
    desc: >
      Registers a puzzle in the puzzle index, and awards a puzzle's assigned item, when solved from Nazobaba house
      (since there is no story event to give you that item normally). Value -1 means no item given in that category. All
      these commands are placed in script/nazobaba/babascript.gds in a list, but only the command corresponding to the
      current puzzle ID will actually execute. (Runs in Event context only)
    uncertain: true
    params:
      puzzleId: int
      hotelId: int
      gizmoId: int
      paintingId: int
  nazobabaGiveAward:
    id: 0xe6
    desc: Responsible for calling babascript.gds (see `0xe5 nazobabaAwards`)
  nazobabaSend:
    id: 0xe7
    uncertain: true
    desc: |
      Sends the specified puzzle to the Nazobaba house, if it wasn't already solved. Also writes all those puzzle names somewhere, but not their IDs.
      It seems these are called in bulk in certain otherwise empty scripts, which in turn are probably called in spots where puzzles would vanish.
    params:
      puzzleId: int
