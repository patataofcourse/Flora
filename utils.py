    """
    Given the file path inputs to the various CLI commands, determines which input files should be operated on and mapped to which output files.

    Input paths are handled as follows:
    - If the input is a file, that file will be used.
    - If the input is a directory, all files in this directory (with the file ending `in_ending`) will be separately treated as input paths.
    - If there is no input (which also means there's no output), the current working directory is used as both input and output
      (which should be fine since most commands produce files of a different ending).
    
    Assuming the input is a file, then if the output is the same this pair is used as-is. Otherwise, if the output isn't specified (or a directory)
    he output path is *inferred* like this:
        - If the input ends with the expected file ending, that is stripped and replaced with the output file ending.
          It's expected that if a user wants more control over this file extension, they should provide an output manually for each input file.
        - If the input has a different ending (or none at all), the output file ending is simply appended to the full name.
    
    This same inference is used if the input is a directory: here we have multiple input paths, for which the targets can not have been specified,
    and so the inference is applied to each of them separately. The output must be a directory (or the input directory itself if not specified) and
    all the output paths are calculated such that input paths relative to the input directory become output paths relative to the output directory
    (i.e. `in/a/b/c.input` becomes `out/a/b/c.output`). If the output exists but isn't a directory, the CLI exits with an error explaining how this doesn't make sense.
